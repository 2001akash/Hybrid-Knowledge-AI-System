  "text": "Delhi, the capital of India, is a mesmerizing blend of ancient history and modern dynamism. This sprawling metropolis offers an incredible journey through time, from the majestic Mughal monuments to contemporary shopping malls and world-class restaurants.

MUST-SEE MONUMENTS:
The Taj Mahal might be in Agra, but Delhi has its own architectural marvels. Start with the Red Fort (Lal Qila), a massive red sandstone fortification built by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1648. The fort complex includes impressive structures like Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) and Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience). Entry fee is ₹35 for Indians and ₹500 for foreigners.

Qutub Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the world's tallest brick minaret at 72.5 meters. Built in 1193, this stunning example of Indo-Islamic architecture is surrounded by several other ancient structures including the Iron Pillar that hasn't rusted in over 1600 years. Best visited early morning or late afternoon.

Humayun's Tomb, another UNESCO site, inspired the design of the Taj Mahal. This 16th-century garden tomb is set in beautiful Charbagh gardens and represents the pinnacle of Mughal architecture. The tomb complex also houses several other tombs of Mughal royalty.

SPIRITUAL DELHI:
The Lotus Temple (Bahá'í House of Worship) is famous for its flower-like shape with 27 marble-clad petals. Open to all regardless of religion, it's a place for meditation and prayer. No photography inside. Free entry.

Akshardham Temple, a modern architectural wonder, showcases 10,000 years of Indian culture through intricate stone carvings. The main monument is built entirely without steel using ancient construction techniques. Evening light and water show is spectacular. Closed Mondays. No cameras or phones allowed inside.

Jama Masjid, India's largest mosque, can hold 25,000 worshippers. Built by Shah Jahan, it features red sandstone and white marble. Climb the minaret for panoramic views of Old Delhi (₹100 for foreigners). Dress modestly and remove shoes.

MARKETS AND SHOPPING:
Chandni Chowk is Old Delhi's chaotic heart - a 400-year-old market offering everything from spices to jewelry. Navigate narrow lanes filled with street food vendors, textile shops, and traditional wedding shops. Don't miss Paranthe Wali Gali for delicious stuffed parathas.

Sarojini Nagar Market is a shopper's paradise for bargain hunters. Expect to haggle hard for export surplus clothes, accessories, and home décor. Best visited on weekdays to avoid crowds.

Dilli Haat is an open-air craft bazaar representing all Indian states. Fixed prices, AC food court with regional cuisines, and beautiful handicrafts make it tourist-friendly. Multiple locations across Delhi.

FOOD EXPERIENCES:
Delhi's street food scene is legendary. Try chaat (savory snacks) at Natraj Dahi Bhalle in Chandni Chowk, butter chicken at Moti Mahal, kebabs at Karim's near Jama Masjid, and kulfi (Indian ice cream) at Roshan Di Kulfi in Karol Bagh.

For fine dining, head to Indian Accent for innovative Indian cuisine, Bukhara at ITC Maurya for the famous dal bukhara and kebabs, or Dum Pukht at ITC Maurya for royal Awadhi cuisine.
